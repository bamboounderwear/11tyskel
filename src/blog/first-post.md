# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting journey that combines creativity with technical skills. Whether you're just starting out or looking to expand your knowledge, there's always something new to learn.

## Key Areas to Focus On

1. HTML - The foundation of web content
2. CSS - Making things look beautiful
3. JavaScript - Adding interactivity
4. Version Control - Managing your code

Remember, the best way to learn is by doing. Start with small projects and gradually increase their complexity as you gain confidence.
